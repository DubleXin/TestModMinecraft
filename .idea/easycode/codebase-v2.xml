This allows integrating a status overlay into the game GUI.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/client/gui/core/HUDSettings.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a HUDSettings class for a Minecraft mod.\\n\\nKey things about this file:\\n\\n- It is in the net.miraistd.testmod.client.gui.core package, indicating it is related to the client-side GUI and core functionality of the TestMod mod.\\n\\n- The class is called HUDSettings, suggesting it contains settings/configuration for the mod\\u0027s heads-up display (HUD).\\n\\n- It is a public class, so other classes can access and use it.\\n\\n- It is currently empty - no fields or methods defined yet. \\n\\nSo in summary, this file:\\n\\n- Defines a class to hold HUD configuration/settings for the TestMod mod\\n- The class is public so it can be accessed by other mod code \\n- It is currently an empty shell and does not contain any settings/functions yet\\n\\nThe purpose is to have a central location to define and manage the settings related to the mod\\u0027s HUD overlay. Future work would add fields and methods to get/set specific HUD settings.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Blocks/QuestionMarkBlock/QuestionMarkBlock.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file registers a new block class for the TestMod mod in Minecraft Forge.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a DeferredRegister for blocks called Blocks, which will register blocks with ForgeRegistries.BLOCKS\\n\\n- Has a register method that takes an event bus and registers the Blocks deferred register with it. This makes the blocks available to Forge. \\n\\n- Defines a registrBlock method that handles registering a new block with a given name, block supplier, and CreativeModeTab. It returns a RegistryObject for the block.\\n\\n- Has a TODO comment to implement registerBlockItem, which would register the item form of the block. \\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Sets up deferred registration of blocks\\n- Registers the blocks register with Forge \\n- Provides a helper method to register new block classes\\n- Will add item registration in the future\\n\\nThe main purpose is to define the infrastructure and registration methods needed to programmatically add new block types to the mod.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Config.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Config.java file defines the configuration for the TestMod mod.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines a ForgeConfigSpec builder to build the configuration spec\\n- Defines ForgeConfigSpec values for different configuration options:\\n  - logDirtBlock - boolean to log dirt block\\n  - magicNumber - integer magic number \\n  - magicNumberIntroduction - string introduction for magic number\\n  - ITEM_STRINGS - list of item names as strings\\n- Builds the final ForgeConfigSpec from the builder\\n- Defines static fields to store the config values\\n- Defines a validator method to validate item names \\n- Has a subscribe event to load the config values on mod load\\n  - Gets the values from the ForgeConfigSpec\\n  - Converts the item name list to a set of actual Item objects\\n\\nIn summary, it:\\n\\n- Defines the mod\\u0027s configuration options and structure\\n- Builds the configuration spec\\n- Provides methods to load and access the config values  \\n- Validates user-provided configuration values\\n\\nSo it handles defining, building, loading and accessing the mod\\u0027s configuration.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/resources/assets/testmod/lang/en_us.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a localization file that defines text strings for various items and GUI elements in the mod.\\n\\nThe key functions of this file are:\\n\\n- Localization - It allows the mod text to be translated into different languages by providing localized string values for each key.\\n\\n- Item Names - It defines the display names for items added by the mod, like \\\&quot;Halberd\\\&quot; and \\\&quot;Sapphire\\\&quot;. This ensures the items show proper readable names in the player\\u0027s language.\\n\\n- Creative Tab - It defines the name for the mod\\u0027s creative tab, which is where added items will be grouped in the creative inventory menu. \\n\\n- Raw Materials - It distinguishes between raw and processed forms of items, like \\\&quot;Raw Sapphire\\\&quot;, to clarify their purpose and usage.\\n\\n- Consistency - It ensures all text related to the mod\\u0027s content is consistent and defined in one place to avoid spelling errors or multiple names for the same thing. \\n\\n- Language Support - By defining the strings with language codes like \\\&quot;en_us\\\&quot;, it supports easy localization to other languages by providing string files for those locales.\\n\\nSo in summary, it centralizes all mod text for localization, item names, and GUI elements into a single JSON file for internationalization.\&quot;,\&quot;/qodana.yaml\&quot;:\&quot;The qodana.yaml file configures Qodana analysis for a project. Some key things it does:\\n\\n- Specifies the version of the Qodana configuration format\\n\\n- Defines the inspection profile to use for code analysis. This selects which code inspections/rules will run.\\n\\n- Allows enabling or disabling specific inspections via include/exclude sections.\\n\\n- Runs a shell command via bootstrap before analysis to prepare the environment. \\n\\n- Installs any necessary IDE plugins via the plugins section before running analysis.\\n\\n- Specifies the Docker image for the Qodana linter container to use for analysis. This controls the version of Qodana used.\\n\\nSo in summary, the main functions of the qodana.yaml file are:\\n\\n- Configure the code inspection profile and rules\\n- Enable/disable specific inspections \\n- Prepare the environment before analysis via bootstrap\\n- Install plugins before analysis\\n- Specify the Qodana linter Docker image to use\\n\\nIt provides the main configuration for customizing how Qodana analysis is performed for the project.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/resources/assets/testmod/models/item/halberd.json\&quot;:\&quot;This JSON file defines the 3D model for an item called a \\\&quot;halberd\\\&quot; in Minecraft.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Sets the parent model to use item/generated, which is the base item model\\n- Defines the texture layer0 to use the texture located at testmod:item/halberd\\n- Configures the first person right hand display:\\n  - Rotates the model 0, 90, 0 degrees\\n  - Translates (positions) the model at 0,0,0\\n  - Scales the model to 2x, 2x, 1x size\\n- Configures the third person right hand display:\\n  - Rotates the model 0, 90, 70 degrees \\n  - Translates the model to 0, 5, 5 position\\n  - Scales the model to 2x, 2x, 1x size\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the texture and configures how the item model should be rendered in both first and third person views when held in the right hand.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/mirai/pair.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a generic Pair class that represents a pair of objects.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- It is a generic class with type parameters A and B, allowing any two types to be used as the pair elements.\\n\\n- It has private fields to store the first and second elements of the pair. \\n\\n- The constructor takes the two elements and assigns them to the fields.\\n\\n- getFirst() and getSecond() methods return the respective element values.\\n\\n- toString() overrides Object\\u0027s toString to print the pair elements enclosed in parentheses.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor - Initializes a new Pair instance with the given element values\\n- getFirst() - Gets the first element \\n- getSecond() - Gets the second element\\n- toString() - Returns a String representation of the pair\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a simple data structure to group two objects together as a pair, with getter methods to access the elements and a string representation. This is useful for returning multiple values together from methods.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/mirai/delegate.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a delegate class in Mirai that allows attaching multiple actions/callbacks to an event.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- The delegate class is a generic class that accepts the return type ReturnType and argument type ArgumentTypes as parameters.\\n\\n- It stores attached actions in a HashSet called _storedActions. \\n\\n- Add() method adds an action to the stored actions set.\\n\\n- Subtract() method removes an action from the stored actions set. \\n\\n- Reset() method clears the stored actions set.\\n\\n- Invoke() method is the main method that invokes all stored actions, passing the given arguments. It collects the return values from each action into a return array and returns it.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Add() - Adds an action \\n- Subtract() - Removes an action\\n- Reset() - Clears all actions\\n- Invoke() - Invokes all stored actions and returns the results\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a delegate pattern to allow attaching multiple callbacks/actions to an event and invoking them all when the event is triggered.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/client/gui/core/HUD.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a HUD (Heads Up Display) class for displaying an in-game status overlay in the top left corner of the screen.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Registers an event listener with Forge to handle drawing the HUD overlay when the game renders GUI elements.\\n\\n- Defines a static IGuiOverlay interface called RENDER that will be called to draw the HUD. \\n\\n- In the RENDER callback it:\\n\\n  - Sets up OpenGL state for 2D GUI rendering\\n\\n  - Creates a StatusHUD component to manage the HUD position/scale\\n\\n  - Renders a background texture\\n\\n  - Draws the player\\u0027s health string\\n\\n- The constructor registers the class as a listener with Forge and TestMod events to hook into the rendering process.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- constructor - Sets up event listeners \\n\\n- RegisterGuiOverlays - Registers the RENDER callback to draw the HUD\\n\\n- RENDER callback - Handles actually drawing the HUD elements each frame\\n\\nSo in summary, it integrates a custom HUD into the game\\u0027s GUI rendering by registering callbacks with Forge and TestMod to draw the overlay on top of the normal GUI.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/utils/ICustomRegistrar.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface called ICustomRegistrar in the net.miraistd.testmod.utils package.\\n\\nSome key things:\\n\\n- It is an interface, meaning it defines a contract/API that classes can implement.\\n\\n- The interface defines 3 static methods:\\n\\n  1. register(IEventBus eventBus) - Registers something with the given event bus. Likely used to register event handlers.\\n\\n  2. add(String name, action\\u003c?, Void\\u003e action) - Adds an action with a given name. Probably used to register custom actions/commands.\\n\\n  3. registerAll() - Calls registration logic on all registered actions/handlers. Used to bulk register everything.\\n\\n- Classes that implement this interface will need to provide implementations of these static methods to perform registration/configuration tasks.\\n\\nSo in summary, this interface defines a common API/contract for classes to register custom actions, event handlers or other configuration using static registration methods. Classes that implement it can then be used to modularly register custom functionality.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/utils/Debug.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Debug.java file contains utility functions for logging debug messages in Minecraft.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Log(Player receiver, String text) - Logs a text message to a specific player.\\n\\n- LogAll(Player[] excludedReceivers, String text) - Logs a text message to all players except those passed in the excludedReceivers array. \\n\\nThis allows selectively logging debug messages to:\\n\\n- The player running commands \\n- All players except certain ones\\n\\nThe messages are sent using the sendSystemMessage Component API to display them ingame. \\n\\nThe LogAll function uses the PlayerManager class to broadcast the message to all online players, excluding any passed in the array.\\n\\nSo in summary, this provides debugging capabilities to selectively log text messages to players ingame for testing and debugging purposes. The functions allow targeting messages to individuals or broadcasting more widely.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Items/ItemRegisterUtil.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file is used for registering items in Forge modding.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- ITEMS - A DeferredRegister for registering items with ForgeRegistries.ITEMS. This allows items to be registered lazily.\\n\\n- register() - Registers the ITEMS DeferredRegister with the given event bus. This makes the items available during runtime. \\n\\n- RegisterItem() - Registers a new item with the ITEMS DeferredRegister. Takes an action to create the item class, and an ICustomItem interface that provides metadata like the name. \\n\\n- ItemsMap - A map that stores the RegistryObject for the item and the ICustomItem metadata for each registered item. This allows looking up items by name.\\n\\n- getItemsMap() - Gets the ItemsMap, which can be used to look up registered items.\\n\\nThe main purpose is to provide a centralized and organized way to register new items in the mod, along with storing metadata for each item. This avoids having to manage registration manually across multiple classes.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/resources/assets/testmod/models/item/raw_sapphire.json\&quot;:\&quot;This JSON file defines a 3D model for an item in Minecraft.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- parent - Specifies the base model this item inherits from. In this case it inherits from the default generated item model in Minecraft.\\n\\n- textures - Defines the texture to apply to the model. There is one layer called \\\&quot;layer0\\\&quot; that will map the texture from the \\\&quot;testmod:item/raw_sapphire\\\&quot; texture file. \\n\\n- By inheriting from the default item model and specifying a texture, this allows the raw_sapphire item to render properly in game with the specified texture mapped to it.\\n\\n- The model and texture files tell the game how to render this custom item visually when it is held, in the inventory, in the world, etc. \\n\\n- By defining the model and texture in a JSON file, it integrates this new raw_sapphire item visually into the game seamlessly using the default item rendering system.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the 3D model and texture for a custom item so that it will render properly throughout the game.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Items/Sapphire/Sapphire.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Sapphire class that represents a sapphire item in Minecraft.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Implements the ICustomItem interface, which defines a registerSelf() method for registering the item\\n- Stores the item name as a string field using Lombok\\u0027s @Getter annotation\\n- Constructor initializes the name field to \\\&quot;sapphire\\\&quot;\\n- registerSelf() method calls ItemRegisterUtil to register a new Item instance, passing the Sapphire instance itself\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a Sapphire class to represent the sapphire item \\n- Stores the item name\\n- Implements item registration through the ICustomItem interface\\n- Calls the item registration utility to register a new Item on startup\\n\\nThe main functions are:\\n\\n- Defining the item class\\n- Storing the item name \\n- Implementing item registration\\n- Calling the registration utility to register the item\\n\\nSo this file defines and registers the sapphire item class for use in the mod.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Items/Registrar.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an item registrar for a Forge mod. Its key functions are:\\n\\n- RegisterAll() - The main registration method that calls all the other registration methods.\\n\\n- registerItems() - Instantiates all the item classes to register them. \\n\\n- instantiateItems() - Instantiates each item class to trigger their registration. This includes Halberd, Sapphire, and RawSapphire items.\\n\\n- registerToEventBus() - Registers all items with the mod event bus using an ItemRegisterUtil class. This allows the items to receive events.\\n\\n- The item classes (Halberd, Sapphire, RawSapphire) each have a registerSelf() method that performs the actual registration of the item with the game registry. \\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n1. Instantiates all item classes \\n2. Registers the items with the mod event bus\\n3. Provides a single entry point (RegisterAll()) to register all items\\n\\nThis allows all the mod items to be registered in a centralized and organized way when the mod is loaded.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/resources/assets/testmod/models/item/sapphire.json\&quot;:\&quot;This JSON file defines a 3D item model for a sapphire item in the testmod mod.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- \\\&quot;parent\\\&quot;: Defines the parent model this model inherits from. In this case it inherits from the default generated item model from Minecraft.\\n\\n- \\\&quot;textures\\\&quot;: Defines the texture layers for the model. There is only one layer (\\\&quot;layer0\\\&quot;) which maps the texture \\\&quot;testmod:item/sapphire\\\&quot;. \\n\\n- By inheriting from the default item model and overriding the texture, this allows the sapphire item to render using the default 3D item shape but with the sapphire texture mapped onto it.\\n\\n- This separates the model definition from the texture definition, so the same basic 3D item shape can be reused for different items just by changing the texture layer mapping.\\n\\n- Allows custom 3D item models to be defined while reusing the existing default item rendering code in Minecraft for consistency with other items.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a custom item texture to apply to the default 3D item shape for a modded sapphire item rendering in Minecraft. The key aspects are inheritance, texture layer mapping, and reusability of the default item model.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/event/ModEvents.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines event handlers for Forge events in the TestMod mod.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- onPlayerLoggedIn - Called when a player logs in. It connects the player to the PlayerManager and initializes the HUD.\\n\\n- onPlayerLoggedOut - Called when a player logs out. It disconnects the player from the PlayerManager. \\n\\n- onPlayerRespawn - Called when a player respawns. It resets the player\\u0027s extended data in PlayerManager.\\n\\n- onClientSetup - Called during client setup. Prints some info to the log.\\n\\n- addCreativeTab - Handles adding items to the creative tab.\\n\\n- commonSetup - Handles common setup across client and server.\\n\\nSo in summary, it handles connecting/disconnecting players to the PlayerManager on login/logout, resets player data on respawn, and has some basic client/common setup handlers. The key purpose is to integrate the player data handling in PlayerManager with Forge player events.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Items/Sapphire/RawSapphire.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a RawSapphire class that represents a raw sapphire item in Minecraft.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- It implements the ICustomItem interface, which is required for items to be registered through the ItemRegisterUtil class.\\n\\n- It has a Name field annotated with @Getter from Lombok, which will generate a getter method for the name. This name (\\\&quot;raw_sapphire\\\&quot;) is used to identify the item.\\n\\n- The registerSelf() method calls ItemRegisterUtil.RegisterItem() to register this item class. This will create a new Item instance using the provided constructor and properties. \\n\\n- By passing \\\&quot;this\\\&quot; as the third argument, it associates the registered item with this RawSapphire class instance.\\n\\nSo in summary, its key functions are:\\n\\n1. Define the item name \\n2. Implement the registration interface\\n3. Call the static registration method to create and register a new Item instance for this class.\\n\\nThis allows this raw sapphire item definition to be automatically registered through the ItemRegisterUtil utility class.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/mirai/testing/ToolTest.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file is part of a test suite for the Mirai bot framework.\\n\\nSome key things about it:\\n\\n- The package name \\\&quot;mirai.testing\\\&quot; indicates it contains test code, not production code.\\n\\n- The class name \\\&quot;ToolTest\\\&quot; suggests it is testing some \\\&quot;Tool\\\&quot; functionality, likely part of the Mirai framework. \\n\\n- It is empty, containing no methods. This is common for test classes - they will be filled out later with specific test methods.\\n\\n- The location under src/main/java follows a standard Maven project structure for Java code.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It is a test file, not production code \\n- It will contain tests related to some \\\&quot;Tool\\\&quot; functionality\\n- It is currently empty and test methods will be added later\\n- It follows standard Java code project structure for a Maven project\\n\\nThe key purpose is to act as a placeholder for future test methods related to some \\\&quot;Tool\\\&quot; functionality within the Mirai bot framework. Even though empty now, it establishes the testing infrastructure and organization for that area.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/client/gui/StatusData.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a StatusData class that holds data related to the player\\u0027s status in the GUI.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Stores a reference to the player object passed in via the constructor. This is a static field so it can be accessed without an instance.\\n\\n- Holds a LevelingData object that contains leveling/experience related data. \\n\\n- Stores the player\\u0027s current mana amount.\\n\\n- Defines a static getHealth() method that returns the player\\u0027s health by accessing it from the stored player reference. \\n\\n- The constructor takes a Player object and sets the internal _player reference.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a central place to store and access various player status data like health, mana, leveling progress etc that can be displayed in the GUI. The static player reference allows getting health without needing an instance of this class.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/client/LevelingData.java\&quot;:\&quot;This LevelingData class is used to store and retrieve leveling data for a player character in the game.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- It is a record class, indicating it is meant to hold data rather than have behavior.\\n\\n- It stores level, experience, job level, job experience, spare stat points, and spare ability points as static fields.\\n\\n- It has getter methods like GetLevel(), GetExperience() to retrieve the stored data. \\n\\n- It has setter methods like setLevel(), setExperience() to set/update the stored data.\\n\\n- The data is stored statically, so it can be accessed from anywhere without needing an instance of the class.\\n\\n- Key functions:\\n  - Getters like GetLevel(), GetExperience() to retrieve leveling data\\n  - Setters like setLevel(), setExperience() to update the stored leveling data\\n\\nSo in summary, this class is used to centrally store and access a player\\u0027s leveling/progression data in the game. The static nature allows easy global access without object instances.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/TestMod.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines the main mod class for a Forge mod called TestMod.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Annotates the class with @Mod, identifying it as the main mod class and setting the mod ID to \\\&quot;testmod\\\&quot;\\n\\n- Registers the mod event bus with FMLJavaModLoadingContext to handle mod events\\n\\n- Registers various items, blocks and creative tabs on initialization:\\n\\n  - Calls Registrar.RegisterAll() to register all items\\n\\n  - Calls QuestionMarkBlock.register() to register the question mark block\\n\\n  - Calls CreativeTabRegistrar.registerAll() to register creative tabs\\n\\n- Logs to SLF4J using a mod-specific logger \\n\\n- Registers the mod class with MinecraftForge\\u0027s event bus to handle Forge events\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Defines the main mod class\\n- Handles mod initialization \\n- Registers items, blocks, tabs on startup\\n- Sets up logging and event handling\\n\\nThis forms the core backbone for the mod to integrate with Forge and Minecraft.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Items/Halberd/Halberd.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Halberd class that represents a halberd item in Minecraft.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Implements the ICustomItem interface, which defines a registerSelf() method for registering the item\\n- Defines a Name field to store the item\\u0027s name\\n- Has a constructor that sets the Name field \\n- Implements registerSelf() to call ItemRegisterUtil\\u0027s RegisterItem method, passing in an Item constructor lambda and the Halberd instance\\n- ItemRegisterUtil handles actually registering the item with the given properties\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a Halberd class to represent the item \\n- Stores the item name\\n- Implements interface for item registration\\n- registerSelf() calls the item registration utility\\n- This registers the item on startup so it can be used in game\\n\\nSo the key functions are defining the item class, storing its name, and implementing the registration interface to actually register it with the game on mod initialization.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/client/gui/core/HUDTransform.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an abstract HUDTransform class that represents the transform (position and scale) of UI elements in a heads-up display (HUD).\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor - Sets default scale of 1.0 and position of (0,0)\\n\\n- getScale() - Gets the scale property \\n\\n- getPosition() - Gets the position property\\n\\n- setScale(float) - Sets the scale, clamping it between min and max limits\\n\\n- setPosition(Vector2f) - Sets the position, clamping it within screen bounds \\n\\n- _minScale, _maxScale - Constants for minimum and maximum allowed scale \\n\\n- _minPosition, _maxPosition - Constants for minimum and maximum allowed screen positions\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a common base class for storing and manipulating the transform of HUD elements, with constraints on valid scale and position values. Subclasses would inherit these transform properties and change/update them as needed for their specific UI components.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/client/ExtendedPlayer.java\&quot;:\&quot;This ExtendedPlayer class extends the vanilla Minecraft Player class to add additional client-side data and functionality.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Stores the player\\u0027s name and a StatusData object containing additional player stats\\n- Can retrieve the actual Player object by name via the PlayerManager\\n- Constructor initializes the name and StatusData on creation\\n- getPlayer() and getPlayerSafe() methods to retrieve the Player object \\n- Validate() method checks if Player is null and reinitializes StatusData\\n- Reset() method resets the internal Player reference and StatusData\\n\\nThe main purpose is to have a client-side player object that can retrieve additional live data like health, hunger, etc via the StatusData, without needing direct access to the server-side Player. It acts as a wrapper that bridges between the name-only client info and actual Player entity.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor to initialize on player join\\n- getPlayer() methods to retrieve Player \\n- Validate() to refresh stale data\\n- Reset() to reset on player change\\n\\nSo in summary, it extends basic player info with live stats and handles mapping between names and actual Player entities.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/mirai/event.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines an event class that extends the delegate class.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a generic event class that takes a ReturnType and ArgumentTypes as type parameters.\\n\\n- Overrides the Invoke method from the delegate class. This method is called when the event is invoked/triggered.\\n\\n- Inside Invoke, it first calls _storedActions.removeIf(Objects::isNull) to clean up any null actions that were registered for this event. \\n\\n- It then calls the superclass Invoke method to actually invoke the event, passing the arguments.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a generic event class that can handle return values and arguments\\n- Overrides Invoke to clean up null actions before invoking \\n- Passes invocation to superclass Invoke method\\n\\nThe main purpose is to define a reusable event class that cleans up null actions before triggering registered callbacks/handlers for that event.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/net/miraistd/testmod/Items/ICustomItem.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface called ICustomItem in the net.miraistd.testmod.Items package.\\n\\nAn interface in Java defines a contract/set of methods that classes can implement. This allows for abstraction and polymorphism.\\n\\nThe ICustomItem interface defines two methods that any class implementing it must provide an implementation for:\\n\\n1. getName() - Returns the name of the item as a String\\n\\n2. registerSelf() - Registers the item with the game. Likely calls a registration method in the main mod class. \\n\\nBy defining this interface, any custom item classes created for this mod can implement ICustomItem. This enforces a common API for items and allows them to be treated polymorphically.\\n\\nSome key things this interface provides:\\n\\n- Abstraction - Items don\\u0027t need to know the concrete class, just that it implements ICustomItem\\n- Polymorphism - Methods can be called on any ICustomItem without knowing the exact class\\n- Encapsulation - The item registration logic is hidden in registerSelf()\\n- Contract - Classes promise to provide getName() and registerSelf() methods\\n\\nSo in summary, it standardizes the API for custom items in this mod to make them easier to work with in a object-oriented way.\&quot;,\&quot;/forge-1.20.1-47.2.0-mdk/src/main/java/mirai/action.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a functional interface for actions in Mirai.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined as a @FunctionalInterface, meaning it can only have one abstract method. This allows it to be used as a lambda or method reference.\\n\\n- The interface is named action and is generic over the return type (ReturnType) and argument types (ArgumentTypes).\\n\\n- It defines a single abstract method called Invoke that takes arguments of type ArgumentTypes and returns ReturnType. \\n\\n- This allows defining reusable \\\&quot;actions\\\&quot; or callbacks that can be passed around and invoked later, in a type-safe way based on the generic parameters.\\n\\n- Some key uses would be defining event handlers, asynchronous callbacks, command mappings etc. Anything that needs to execute an action in response to something.\\n\\n- The generic types allow strong typing of the return value and arguments, avoiding issues like unchecked casts.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a standard functional interface definition for reusable \\\&quot;actions\\\&quot; or callbacks within the Mirai framework in a typesafe way using Java generics. The Invoke method is the single entry point for executing such actions.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
